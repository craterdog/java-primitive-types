### Java Primitive Types
This project contains a set of additional Java primitive type classes. Each class follows the same immutability
conventions that the native Java primitive types support. They also provide a default implementation
of the canonical `Object` class methods.

### Highlighted Components
The following highlights the new primitive types that this project provides:

 * *Angle* - representing the mathematical concept of an angle in radians in the range (-pi..pi]
 * *BinaryString* - an extension of `byte[]` that adds support for the `craterdog.core.Sequential` and
`craterdog.core.Composite` interfaces
 * *Probability* - representing a mathematical probability in the range [0.0..1.0]
 * *Tag* - a unique identifier of any length displayed in base 32 format
 * *TextString* - an extension of the `java.lang.String` class that adds support for the `craterdog.core.Sequential`
interface
